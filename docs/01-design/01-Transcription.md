## Transcription

### Character Set Limitation:
- Use Basic Latin Alphabet: URIs should only include characters from the basic Latin alphabet, digits, and a few special characters. This ensures compatibility across different systems and locales.
- Avoid Non-ASCII Characters: Stick to characters that can be easily entered on various keyboards to avoid transcription errors.
### Transcription Considerations:
- Human Readability: Design URIs to be easily transcribable by humans. This means avoiding complex or non-intuitive sequences.
- Meaningful Components: Use meaningful or familiar components in URIs to make them easier to remember and type.
### Representation Flexibility:
- Multiple Representations: URIs can be represented in various forms (e.g., ink on paper, pixels on a screen). Ensure that the interpretation of a URI is consistent regardless of its representation.
- Percent-Encoding: Use percent-encoded octets to represent characters outside the US-ASCII range if necessary. Ensure the encoding scheme is well-defined and consistent.
### Design Considerations:
- Transcription Over Meaning: Prioritize the ability to transcribe URIs across different media over having the most meaningful components. This helps in maintaining consistency and accessibility.
- Local and Regional Contexts: Be aware that local or regional contexts might benefit from a wider range of characters. However, this should be handled carefully to maintain compatibility.
### Protocol Independence:
- Character Interpretation: The interpretation of a URI should depend only on the characters used, not on how they are represented in a network protocol. This ensures that URIs remain consistent across different protocols and systems.
## Example Scenario
- Imagine two colleagues, Sam and Kim, exchanging research ideas at a conference. Kim writes a URI on a napkin for Sam to access later. When Sam types the URI into a computer, it retrieves the intended information. This scenario highlights the importance of designing URIs that are easy to transcribe and remember.
