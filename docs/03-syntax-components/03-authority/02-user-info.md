## URI Userinfo Subcomponent

### Overview
The `userinfo` subcomponent may consist of a user name and, optionally, scheme-specific information about how to gain authorization to access the resource. The user information, if present, is followed by a commercial at-sign (`@`) that delimits it from the host.

### Syntax
`userinfo = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" )`

### Components
* userinfo: Optional user information, which may include a username and password.

### Guidelines
* Deprecated Format: Use of the format user:password in the userinfo field is deprecated.
* Rendering Userinfo:
  * Applications should not render as clear text any data after the first colon (:) character found within a userinfo subcomponent unless the data after the colon is the empty string (indicating no password).
  * Applications may choose to ignore or reject such data when received as part of a reference and should reject the storage of such data in unencrypted form.
  
* Security Risks: Passing authentication information in clear text has proven to be a security risk in almost every case where it has been used.
* User Feedback:
  * Applications that render a URI for user feedback, such as in graphical hypertext browsing, should render userinfo in a way that is distinguished from the rest of a URI, when feasible.
  * This rendering will assist the user in cases where the userinfo has been misleadingly crafted to look like a trusted domain name.
  
### Practical Guide
* Constructing URIs:
  * Avoid including sensitive information in the userinfo field.
  * Example: `http://username@www.example.com/path.`
* Parsing URIs:
  * Use URI parsing libraries to handle userinfo securely.
  * Example in Python:
  ```python
    from urllib.parse import urlparse
    url = 'http://user:password@www.example.com/path'
    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    print(parsed_url)
  ```

* Handling Deprecated Formats:
  * Ensure applications do not render passwords in clear text.
  * Example: Mask or omit the password when displaying the URI.
* Enhancing Security:
  * Reject or ignore userinfo data that includes a password unless it is empty.
  * Store any received userinfo data in encrypted form.
* User Interface Considerations:
  * Clearly distinguish userinfo from the rest of the URI in user interfaces to prevent phishing attacks.
  * Example: Display userinfo in a different color or font style.
