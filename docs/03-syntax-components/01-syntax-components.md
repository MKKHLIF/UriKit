A **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)** is a string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet. The generic URI syntax is composed of several components arranged hierarchically:

1. **Scheme**: Indicates the protocol to be used (e.g., `http`, `https`, `ftp`).
2. **Authority**: Includes the user information, host, and port (e.g., `example.com:8042`).
3. **Path**: Specifies the resource within the authority (e.g., `/over/there`).
4. **Query**: Provides additional data to the resource (e.g., `?name=ferret`).
5. **Fragment**: Identifies a secondary resource or a portion of the primary resource (e.g., `#nose`).

The general structure of a URI is: `scheme://authority/path?query#fragment`.


### Hierarchical Part (hier-part)

The `hier-part` can take several forms:
- `//authority path-abempty`: When authority is present, the path must be empty or start with a slash (`/`).
- `path-absolute`: Starts with a slash but no authority.
- `path-rootless`: Does not start with a slash and no authority.
- `path-empty`: No characters.

#### Example: Full URI Breakdown `foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose`
````
Scheme: `foo`
Authority: `example.com:8042`
    Host: `example.com`
    Port: `8042`
Path: `/over/there`
Query: `name=ferret`
Fragment: `nose`
````
### Practical Implementation Tips

1. **Parsing URIs**: When building a web server or backend system, ensure your URI parser can handle different URI components correctly. For instance, in C++ you might use a library like `uriparser` to break down and validate URIs.

2. **Handling Paths**: Be mindful of the path rules:
    - If `authority` is present, the path must start with `/` or be empty.
    - If `authority` is absent, the path must not start with `//`.

3. **Security Considerations**: Always validate and sanitize URI components to prevent injection attacks. For example, ensure that query parameters are properly encoded and decoded.

4. **Relative URIs**: Implement logic to resolve relative URIs against a base URI. This is crucial for web applications that dynamically generate links.
